# You need a pair of AWS access keys with permission to use a specific 
# KMS key. This provides one layer of encryption for your private key.

# You can ask the Ferrum team to assign you an access pair and a KMS key
# If you want to mange your own KMS key (preferred approach)
# Create a KMS key in AWS and add permissions to your user to use the KMS
# key ARN to "ecnrypt", "decrypte", and "createDataKey"
