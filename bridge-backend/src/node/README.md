# How to set up a node

Birdge V1:

a) Generator
b) Validator
c) Master node

### Preqquisits:

- secure vm
- docker
- aws keys with access to a kms key (Ferrum team can provide you this)
- access to Frreum 2fa service (public and private hamc keys)
- access to Ferrum backend (public and private hmac keys)

In total you will need three sets of keys, one for an AWS account to encrypt keys locally. And two from Ferrum.

## Generator:

Generator, only generates requsts. It interacts with the Ferrum backend and chain to do so.
